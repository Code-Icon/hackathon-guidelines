### Use of .gitignore

- Participants must use an appropriate `.gitignore` file.
- System files, build files, and dependency folders must not be committed.
- Examples:
  - node_modules/
  - dist/
  - build/
  - .env
  - .DS_Store

You can generate proper `.gitignore` files using:

This is a widely used and trusted open-source tool.
